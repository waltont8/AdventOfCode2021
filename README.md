## Day 1: Sonar Sweep
Just zipwith the list of numbers with itself using (>) to get a list of bools. Transpose and sum on part 2 to add the lists.

Most of these I do a quick answer then go and find nicer ways to do it much later on.

## Day 2: Dive!
Was warming up my integer trig package when I read "aim" in part 2, but was a simple addition to part 1 in the end. Bodged the read function, which ugly, but a lot faster to type than doing the proper invertible syntax descriptions one
